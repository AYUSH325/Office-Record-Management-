# Office-Record-Management-

This project uses the concept of Python, SQL and SQL-Python Connectivity .

The project uses the office database to make changes to the table employee stored in the office database using python shell.
At first, the user has to go through a security check-in in order to prevent theft of private details. The user has been given three chances to enter password correctly.

Then, a menu driven program is encountered from where we can choose to insert a new record containing the details of a new employee who joined the office, delete the details of an employee who resigned from the office, update the salary of an employee who received promotion, update the designation of an employee who received promotion or display the details of any employee who you want to select.

In order to prevent errors the whole program is placed in a try-except block and messages relevant are printed.
